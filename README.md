Modular Kolonization System (MKS) 
===

This is the repository for the MKS and OKS mods for [Kerbal Space Program](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com)

MKS and OKS are the original works of RoverDude (GitHub user BobPalmer).  

You can find the official repo for this mod on [Github](http://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS).  Releases, along with other USI products, can be found on [the USI Catalog Page](http://bobpalmer.github.io/UmbraSpaceIndustries/).
